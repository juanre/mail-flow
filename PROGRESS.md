# Progress Report: pmail Implementation

## ✅ Phase 1: Core Infrastructure (COMPLETE)

### 1.1 Enhanced Email Feature Extraction ✅
- ✅ Attachment detection (PDF, DOC, images)
- ✅ Extract sender domain and email provider
- ✅ Parse common patterns in subject lines
- ✅ Extract key phrases from body
- ✅ Pass full Message object through pipeline for attachment extraction

### 1.2 Data Persistence Layer ✅
- ✅ Create `~/.config/pmail/` config directory structure
- ✅ Implement `criteria_instances.json` for historical decisions
- ✅ Implement `workflows.json` for workflow definitions
- ✅ Add backup/versioning for data files
- ✅ Atomic file operations for data integrity

### 1.3 Criteria Instance Model ✅
- ✅ CriteriaInstance stores concrete examples
- ✅ Store: email_id, timestamp, selected_workflow, extracted_features, user_confirmed
- ✅ Confidence scoring included
- ⚠️  Negative examples (skipped workflows) not explicitly stored

## ✅ Phase 2: Similarity Engine (COMPLETE)

### 2.1 Feature Vector Creation ✅
- ✅ Convert email attributes to features
- ✅ Implement configurable feature weights
- ✅ Handle categorical (sender domain) and text features

### 2.2 Similarity Scoring ✅
- ✅ Jaccard similarity for text comparison
- ✅ Composite score from multiple features
- ✅ REMOVED recency weighting (per user request - older criteria equally valuable)

### 2.3 Workflow Ranking ✅
- ✅ Score all workflows against current email
- ✅ Return top N workflows with confidence scores
- ✅ Feature explanation system

## ✅ Phase 3: User Interface Enhancement (COMPLETE)

### 3.1 Interactive Workflow Selection ✅
- ✅ Show ranked workflows with similarity percentages
- ✅ Display why each workflow matched
- ✅ Allow creating new workflow if none fit
- ✅ Quick key navigation (1-9 for top choices)
- ✅ Workflow templates for common patterns

### 3.2 Criteria Refinement UI ⚠️
- ✅ Extracted criteria automatically saved
- ❌ No UI to modify criteria after extraction
- ❌ No strong/weak example marking

## ✅ Phase 4: Mutt Integration (COMPLETE)

### 4.1 Mutt Macro Setup ✅
- ✅ Create macro that pipes full email to pmail
- ✅ Handle both single emails and tagged sets
- ✅ Return status to mutt (success/failure)

### 4.2 Workflow Execution ✅
- ✅ Implement workflow actions:
  - ✅ save_attachment
  - ✅ save_pdf (intelligent PDF handling)
  - ✅ save_email_as_pdf
  - ✅ flag
  - ✅ copy_to_folder
  - ✅ create_todo
- ✅ Execution feedback to user
- ❌ No dry-run mode

## ⚠️ Phase 5: Learning & Improvement (PARTIAL)

### 5.1 Accretion Mechanism ⚠️
- ✅ Every decision saved as training data
- ✅ System improves predictions over time
- ❌ No automatic merging of similar criteria
- ❌ No pruning of rarely-used rules

### 5.2 Analytics & Reporting ❌
- ❌ No usage statistics
- ❌ No ambiguous email identification
- ❌ No rule improvement suggestions

## 🎯 Additional Features Implemented (Not in Original Plan)

### PDF Generation and Handling ✅
- ✅ Email-to-PDF conversion using Playwright
- ✅ Intelligent save_pdf that handles both attachments and conversion
- ✅ HTML cleaning for better PDF output
- ✅ Security measures (size limits, external request blocking)

### Code Quality Infrastructure ✅
- ✅ Comprehensive test suite (52 tests)
- ✅ Black formatting (99 char line length)
- ✅ Pre-commit and pre-push hooks
- ✅ Configuration for isort, ruff, mypy

### Security Features ✅
- ✅ Path validation and sanitization
- ✅ Filename sanitization
- ✅ Resource limits (attachment count, file sizes)
- ✅ Safe JSON operations

## Summary

**Completed**: 85% of planned features plus additional enhancements
**Core Functionality**: Fully operational
**Learning System**: Working but could be enhanced
**Areas for Future Work**:
- Analytics and reporting
- Criteria merging/pruning
- Dry-run mode
- UI for modifying extracted criteria

The system is production-ready and exceeds the original plan in several areas, particularly around PDF handling and code quality.
